## What is DiscoverNews?
DiscoverNews is an React app created for the Capital One Software Engineering Summit 2020 that finds articles from three categories (Entertainment, Sports, and     Technology). The web application uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/ "News API Documentation") to fetch information about the articles.  All of the information about the article is presented to a user in a material-ui card, which provides brief, important information about the article. In addition, each card is able to share the link of the article through Facebook, Twitter, or Email to other users.

## What I used to build DiscoverNews! 
#### [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React") 
* I utilized many prevalent concepts found in professional React development, including a modular component design, ReactDOM, ReactRouter, HTTP requests, hooks, and routes.
#### [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/ "Material-UI") and [Material-UI UI/UX Guide](https://material.io/design "Material-UI Design UI/UX Guide")
* I incorporated many Material UI components in many aspects of DiscoverNews such as Tabs, Card, and Icons to present a user-friendly format that provides concise information about the news article. 
* In addition, I have followed and implemented the Material-UI designs choices from their documentation to build an amazing user experience!
#### [News API](https://newsapi.org/ "News API Documentation") 
*  I used News API, a simple and easy-to-use API that returns JSON metadata for headlines and articles live all over the web right now.
#### [Material UI SearchBar](https://github.com/TeamWertarbyte/material-ui-search-bar, "Material-UI Searchbar") 
* Finally, I used this Material-UI Searchbar from GitHub to create the searchbar for our users to search for articles on DiscoverNews

## Why I wish to attend Capital One Software Engineering Summit?
I would like to attend Capital One Software Engineering Summit to learn more about how Capital One's culture aligns with my career and personal goals. In addition, I would also like to meet and network with other peers who have a similar vision and goals to me while particpating and improving our technical skillsets at Capital One Software Engineering Summit's Hackathon. Finally, Capital One Software Engineering Summit will allow me to find what I'm truly interested within the technology industry. 

## What is DiscoverNews?
DiscoverNews is an React app created for the Capital One Software Engineering Summit 2020 that finds articles from three categories (Entertainment, Sports, and     Technology). The web application uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/ "News API Documentation") to fetch information about the articles.  All of the information about the article is presented to a user in a material-ui card, which provides brief, important information about the article. In addition, each card is able to share the link of the article through Facebook, Twitter, or Email to other users. 

## What I used to build DiscoverNews! 
#### [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React") 
* I utilized many prevalent concepts found in professional React development, including a modular component design, ReactDOM, ReactRouter, HTTP requests, hooks, and routes.
#### [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/ "Material-UI") and [Material-UI UI/UX Guide](https://material.io/design "Material-UI Design UI/UX Guide")
* I incorporated many Material UI components in differnet aspects of DiscoverNews such as Tabs, Card, and Icons to present a user-friendly format that provides concise information about the news article. 
* In addition, I have followed and implemented the Material-UI designs choices from their documentation to build an amazing user experience!
#### [News API](https://newsapi.org/ "News API Documentation") 
*  I used News API, a simple and easy-to-use API that returns JSON metadata for headlines and articles live all over the web right now.
*  DiscoverNews sends HTTP Requests and recieves HTTP Response from the News API.
#### [Material UI SearchBar](https://github.com/TeamWertarbyte/material-ui-search-bar, "Material-UI Searchbar") 
* Finally, I used this Material-UI Searchbar from a GitHub repo to create the searchbar for our users to search for articles on DiscoverNews 

## What did I learn from building DiscoverNews 
Although I had a bit experience using React, I was not familar with any concepts relating to UI/UX design. Through further research on Google, I stumbled upon Material-UI design docs and Adobe XD. Quickly, I designed the front-end of DiscoverNews in Adobe XD and learned how to place React Components in the correct place to build a better user-experience! Finally, I learned how to budget time and energy for DiscoverNews while working a full-time Software Engineering job by planning deadlines to complete key features of DiscoverNews. 

## Future Features of DiscoverNews 
In the next iteration of DiscoverNews, I would like to implement many exciting features to improve the experience of finding new articles around the world : 
* Firebase for user authentication with Google sign-in 
* Bookmarking favorite articles 
* User history of viewing different articles 
* Build a cross-platform mobile application with React Native or Flutter
